# LoRAM: Magnitude-Driven LoRA Initialization for Effortless High Performance

Tired of complex spectral initialization methods that slow down your LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning? LoRAM is your solution. Our lightweight initialization scheme for LoRA simplifies the process of optimizing large models, delivering spectral-level performance without the extra computational and storage headaches.

**Why LoRAM?**
- **Effortless Efficiency**: LoRAM ditches the cumbersome computations and storage demands of traditional spectral methods. It's a plug-and-play approach that integrates seamlessly with existing LoRA setups, saving you time and resources.
- **Insight-Driven Design**: We've cracked the code on what truly drives LoRA performance - the magnitude of weight updates (**Please see our Paper**!). LoRAM uses this insight to scale deterministic orthogonal bases with pretrained weight magnitudes, a simple yet powerful strategy that mimics spectral gains without the complexity.
- **Proven Results**: Across multiple benchmarksfor LLM, MLLM and Flow Model, LoRAM stands as a robust baseline, matching or surpassing spectral initialization while maintaining the full parameter efficiency of LoRA.

If you're looking for a straightforward, high-performing way to initialize LoRA for your large model tuning tasks, LoRAM is the way to go. No more juggling hyperparameters or dealing with excessive overhead - just fast convergence and top-notch performance, right out of the box.
